This example demonstrates a common error in Rust: multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  Rust's borrow checker prevents data races by ensuring that only one mutable reference to a given variable exists at any time. Attempting to create multiple mutable borrows results in a compile-time error.  The solution shows how to restructure the code to avoid this error, either by using temporary variables or cloning.
